Sentiment Analysis btc_bot
General Idea: I believe that sentiment is often heavily affecting the prices and direction of the short term movements. Therefore, in a daily position, if the positive is more than negative news, we will establish a long position. If the next day, the same positive is more than negative, we maintain and hold position. However, if the increase of negative news in a 6hr period is more than positive news (not clear), we need to close the position --> signalling something is changing in the fundamental field.
