Therefore, in a daily position, if the positive is more than negative news, we will establish a long position. If the next day, the same positive is more than negative, we maintain and hold position. However, if the increase of negative news in a 6hr period is more than positive news (not clear), we need to close the position --> signalling something is changing in the fundamental field.\n",

On the other side, any declines below the 9-day moving average could easily open the way to the south.</p>, <p>However, the breakdown below $48,000 is not out of the picture because the losses in the last few days show that BTC/USD may not be technically ready for the breakout above $52,000. Looking at the daily chart, Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to regain ground by moving the market price to the next level. Moreover, any bullish movement above the 21-day moving average may push the price to the resistance levels of $55,000, $57,000, and $59,000 while the supports are located at $45,000, $43,000, and $41,000 respectively.</p>, <p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the Bitcoin price remains above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages as the coin move towards the upper boundary of the channel. Therefore, if the price continues to rise further, it could reach the potential resistance levels at $52,000, $54,000, and $56,000 respectively.</p>, <p>Moreover, if the bears push the coin below the 9-day and 21-day moving averages; it may likely hit the closest supports at $48,000, $46,000, and $44,000.

The 14-day SMA trend line has bent southward to touch the 50-day SMA trend line at $55,000. The Stochastic Oscillators have, over time, been consolidating around the range of 20, so much involving the oversold region. That signifies that the market is somewhat responsive to depression until the present.<br/></p>, <p>At this point, it is still somewhat dicey to suggest the definite direction that <a href=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/buy-cryptocurrency/buy-bitcoin%7C\">the BTC/USD market may</a> push into as the crypto-economic price lowers, averaging a $45,000 support level. The market, as of writing, experiences a process of making a bullish candlestick to indicate a return of an upward motion. A low-active down-pull tends to make the trade get repositioned to energize the movement back to the upside.<br/><br/>On the downside of the technical analysis, the market resistance trading level at $50,000 remains solidly to portend a barrier zone against smooth runs to the north side. Traders intending to continue to go more shorts on this market have to take note of a rejection possibility around the upper bearish trend line to observe healthier decent sell order positions. The $45,000 trading may not easily breach southward sustainably afterward.<br/><a href=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-313799 size-full\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11.png 941w, https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11-300x189.png 300w, https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11-768x483.png 768w\" height=\"592\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20941%20592'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"941\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-313799 size-full\" height=\"592\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" src=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11.png\" srcset=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11.png 941w, https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11-300x189.png 300w, https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4HRBTCUSDCHARTDEC11-768x483.png 768w\" width=\"941\"/></noscript></a></p>, <p>The <a href=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-usd-prepares-to-climb-50000\">BTC/USD</a> 4-hour chart also reveals that the crypto-economic price lowers, averaging a $45,000 support level. So many trading activities have taken place around $52,500, $50,000, and $47,500. A bullish candlestick is presently signifying an upswing after touching the lowest value line. The 14-day SMA indicator bends southward, closely above the Japanese trading candlestick beneath the 50-day SMA indicator. The Stochastic Oscillators have stretched the lines close underneath the range of 80. That suggests that the market is relatively pushing for recovery.<br/><br/></p>, <p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Looking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?

      "[<p><strong>Bitcoin Price Prediction – December 12</strong></p>, <p>The Bitcoin price prediction is on the brink of breaking above $50,000 following a momentous rally yesterday that has seen it rise to $49,700.</p>, <p>Key levels:</p>, <p>Resistance Levels: $54,000, $56,000, $58,000</p>, <p>Support Levels: $45,000, $43,000, $41,000</p>, <p style=\"text-align: center\"></p>, <p>According to the daily chart, <a href=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/buy-cryptocurrency/buy-bitcoin\">BTC/USD</a> touches $49,721 as all-time high beckons. The first digital asset is seen trading around the 9-day moving average. The Bitcoin price is now within touching distance of forming a new all-time high above the opening price at $49,424.</p>, <p>The <a href=\"https://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-usd-prepares-to-climb-50000\">Bitcoin price</a> has been able to clearly break above $49,000 and reach a price per coin of $49,721. The main question is whether it will be able to hit the resistance level of $50,000 where it may usually find large resistance. Therefore, traders may likely wait for a continuation of the bull trend which could help the first digital asset reach new highs.</p>, <p>Moreover, for Bitcoin to would have reached $49,700, this could be the beginning of a new bull run in the crypto space. Meanwhile, as the technical indicator Relative Strength Index (14) is likely to cross above 40-level and the Bitcoin price may soon hit the potential resistance levels at $54,000, $56,000, and $58,000 while sliding below the lower boundary of the channel could drag the price to the critical support levels of $45,000, $43,000, and $41,000 respectively.</p>, <p>On the 4-hour chart, BTC/USD is currently trading around $49,491 above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages after a reversal from $49,012 where the market started trading today while the Bitcoin price is now moving towards the north as the red-line of the 9-day MA is crossing above the green-line of the 21-day MA.</p>, <p>However, if buyers could strengthen and energize the market, they can further push the price towards the channel which could allow the market price to hit the resistance level of $51,000 and above. Meanwhile, the technical indicator Relative Strength Index (14) is currently moving above 50-level, but any bearish movement below the moving averages may drag the price to the support level of $48,000 and below.</p>, <p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Looking to buy or trade Bitcoin (BTC) now?
